## Cancer Staging

The **Bigham-Young cancer staging methodology** is a system used to classify the severity and progression of cancer, helping in the treatment planning and prognosis assessment. It involves evaluating several factors, including tumor size and extent (T), lymph node involvement (N), and the presence of metastasis (M), similar to the widely used TNM staging system. This methodology provides a structured way to categorize cancer stages from early, localized disease to advanced, metastatic cancer, allowing healthcare providers to develop personalized treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes more accurately.

## The main steps of the Brigham-Young cancer staging methodology are as follows:

1. **Tumor Assessment (T)**: Determine the size and extent of the primary tumor.
2. **Lymph Node Evaluation (N)**: Check for the involvement of regional lymph nodes.
3. **Metastasis Detection (M)**: Assess whether the cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues.
4. **Histopathological Analysis**: Analyze the tumor's cellular characteristics and grade.
5. **Stage Classification**: Combine the gathered data to classify the cancer into a specific stage, guiding treatment decisions and prognosis.
